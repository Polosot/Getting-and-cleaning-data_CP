## Reading the RAW data
### RAW data folder
The location of RAW-dataset is saved in `datadir` variable.

The folder contains the files with the refer data, both for the `test` and `train` data set (i.e. activities and variables maps), and two subfolders with identical structure. The subfolders are named `test` and `train`.
